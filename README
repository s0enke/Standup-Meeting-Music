Simple ruby script which starts a Chromium instance in Xvfb and plays a random video from "Standupfile"

inspired by http://scrumburg.wordpress.com/2011/11/13/wake-up-call-fur-das-daily-scrum/

Use this as cronjob - example usage:

28 10 * * 1-5 /path/to/standup.rb 120

will play one of your standup songs mon-fri at 10:28am for 120 secs.

We installed this on our metrics/logs dashboard.
